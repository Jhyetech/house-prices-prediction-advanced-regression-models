# house-prices-prediction-advanced-regression-models
This project aimed to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques. 


The goal of the project was to build a regression model to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa. The initial model yielded a score of 0.60907. In order to improve the accuracy of the model, the data was preprocessed by dropping irrelevant columns, filling missing values, creating new features, one-hot encoding categorical columns, scaling numerical features, and reducing dimensionality using PCA. The processed data was split into train and validation sets and used to train a Ridge regression model with an alpha of 10. This model yielded a validation score of 0.23812. A Random Forest model was also trained using GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters. The best hyperparameters were n_estimators=100, max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2, and min_samples_leaf=1. The trained Random Forest model yielded a validation score of 0.13592, which is a significant improvement over the initial score. Overall, the improvements made to the data preprocessing and model training led to a more accurate model for predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa
